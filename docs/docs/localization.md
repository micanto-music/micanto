# Localization
Micanto uses the <a href="https://www.i18next.com/" target="_balnk">i18n</a> package for localization.
Currently there are german and english.

## Change labels
To change labels go to the public folder, locales and the language you want to change. For example:
`/public/locales/en/translation.json` and change all the labels you want. WARNING. If you using docker or updating micanto your labels will get overridden.

## Add your language
Just add a new folder to the locales directory `/public/locales/` for your language and start. If you are happy with it, please make a pull request for other users <a href="https://github.com/micanto-music/micanto">here</a>!
